# Final Project - Hotel Management System
## I continued my previous work and added some new things I've _learned_ in this semester 
This project consists of:
1. Spring Data JPA (MySQL)
2. 4 Rest Controllers
3. Mappings, Requests(implemented into WebSite)
4. Basic Security using JWT
5. Repositories and Implementations
6. Clean code with the help of Lombokize 
7. 4 handled exceptions
8. Simple WebSite

## Logic:
I wanted to create application of Hotel to easily manage rooms, to make easier clients to book rooms.
There are many types of rooms and they have fixed cost, rating and they are reserved by some clients from X date to Y date.
