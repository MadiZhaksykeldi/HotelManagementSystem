# Endterm Project - Hotel Management System
##I continued my previous work and added some new things I've _learned_ in this attestation
This project consists of:
1. Spring Data JPA, personally did with MySQL
2. Rest Controllers
3. Mappings, Requests(works 50/50 sometimes, in some situations it doesn't change anything in DB even thought it is same exact code)
4. Basic Security using JWT
5. Repositories and Implementations
6. Clean code with the help of Lombokize 
7. 4 handled exceptions

## Brief Logic:
Basically there are many types of rooms and they have fixed cost, rating and they are reserved by some clients from X date to Y date.
